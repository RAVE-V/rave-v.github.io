# "Now we are just 1's and 0's apart"<br>

<br>

I am 3rd year undergrad in **Information Technology** at the [Adi Shankara Institute](http://www.adishankara.ac.in/), Kerala, India. I am also doing my **Certified Ethical Hacking** at the moment. What inspires me is the vast amount of information and the how-to's which led me here. My efforts greatly goes into programming, researching about cybersecurity. Currently into **Web Application Security**. Other than this probably you'll be seeing me listen to music or watch some inspiring movies.
