# "Now we are just 1's and 0's apart"<br>

<br>

I am currently doing my postgrad in **Cyber Security** at the [University of the West of England](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/), Bristol, United kingdom. Also Practicing for  **OSCP** at the moment. What inspires me is the vast amount of information and the how-to's which led me here. My efforts greatly goes into programming, researching about cybersecurity. Currently into **Web Application Security**. Other than this probably you'll see me listen to music or watch some inspiring movies.
